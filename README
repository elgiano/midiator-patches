Patches to MIDIator driver classes to achieve compatibility with both ruby 1.8 and 1.9

A patch to achieve MIDI event receiving has been added. It has only been implemented for ALSA drivers though. To try it out copy 'reading.rb' in your 'lib/midiator/' folder and patch 'midiator.rb' to include it.
